# ITDT Ontology
The extension of [Records in Contexts Ontology](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O) in archival domain created for the description of the records of Dino Tamburini (1924-2011), architect
and engineer from Trieste, Italy. The name of the ontology comes from common practice of naming archives with country code and creator initials.
The ontology is thought to accommodate description of particular documentary types of architectural archives of XX century and 
the knowledge process behind architectural projects.
